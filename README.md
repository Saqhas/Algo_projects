# Algo_projects

These are some of my Projects that I made in the 1st and 2nd Year of College .
They are Primarly for Data structure and Algorithm course

The Description of the Projects are :
	
	1) ALGO PROJECT.CPP
		This is a Program that computes the minimum cost for a journey from a Position A to a Position B .
		The Map and the cost for each road is to be specified in the array arr1 at line no. 102 .
		The code can be easily modified to make it user friendly.
		This will give the cost and the route to be taken between the final and initial destination.
		The data structures used in theis are :
			1) Array.
			2) Sets
			3) Linked List
			4) Binary Heaps
			5) Classes
			6)  


		The Algorithms used in this are :
		1) Dikistra Shortest Path algorithm
		2) Heap Perculate up and Down.
